// Here in this component first we should pass the props object in the required parameters. See the README example.

// After doing so we just have to replace the *Your name* with the "name" field of our props object.

// In React You can pass a javascript variable inside a jsx tag simply by wrapping it in {}

import React from 'react';

const Intro = () => {
    return <p>My name is *Your name* and I am learning React!</p>;
