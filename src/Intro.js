// Here in this component first we should pass the props object in the required parameters. See the README example.

// After doing so we just have to replace the *Your name* with the "name" field of our props object.

// In React You can pass a javascript variable inside a jsx tag simply by wrapping it in {}

const Intro = () => {
  return <p>My name is *Your name* and I am learning React!</p>;
};

export { Intro };

// When you are finished go back to the App.js file
