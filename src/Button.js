// Here we want to render a button. When we click it, we want an alert to
// show on the screen saying "Button was clicked"!
const Button = () => {
  // Can you do it by yourelf? If you need help, head to the previous component
  // or the README.

  return <button>Click Me</button>;
};

export { Button };

// When you are done you should be seeing alerts whenever you click the button
// or change the value in the input. Congratulations you learned Event Handling!
