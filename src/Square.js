// Here is where our square component lives! We would like it to have different
// background color according to a boolean prop called isGreen. If isGreen is
// true, then we should add a css class called 'green', otherwise, we should add
// a css class called 'blue'. Don't worry about the css, it has already been
// taken care of!

// For example if I wanted to give a `div` a different class according to a
// condition:

/*
  const Table = () => {
    const hasFourLegs = true;

    return <div className={hasFourLegs ? 'four-legs' : 'three-legs'}></div>;
  };
*/

const Square = (props) => {
  return <div></div>;
};

export { Square };

// When you are finished go to Circle.js to continue!
