// In this Component we would like to return a <h1>Hello World!</h1> When you are
// done, go to the Intro.js file to continue!

// Don't forget to export it too! Otherwise it won't be available to the rest of
// the application! For example if I wanted to export a Component named Scores:
// export { Scores };
