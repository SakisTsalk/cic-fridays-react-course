# CIC Fridays React Course

The goal of this course is to learn more about [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Format

For 3 Fridays, we will cover a selection of core concepts. We will have a brief theoretical introduction and follow it up with hands on exercises.

## Initialize the project

Clone this repo in your directory of choice on your computer: `git clone https://github.com/pgzisis/cic-fridays-react-course.git`.

Open the `cic-fridays-react-course` folder with your code editor.

In the project's root folder open a terminal:

Install the project's dependencies: `npm install`

Run the development server: `npm start`

A new tab should open in your browser pointing to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

Now, whenever you make changes on an exercise and save them, they should automatically be reflected on the browser!

## Going to exercises

To go to the exercises, you have to switch to the relevant git branch.

For example, If I wanted to visit the components exercises, I would have to: `git checkout components`

Notice that if you have made changes in a branch and you switch to another one, your changes will carry over to the new branch. To avoid this:

Stage your changes: `git add --all`

Commit them: `git commit -m "Replace this example commit message"`

You are ready to checkout another exercise branch!

## Exercise branches (ordered)

1. `components`
2. `props`
3. `conditional-rendering`
4. `handling-events`
5. `state`
6. `lifting-state-up`
